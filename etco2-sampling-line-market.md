<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EtCO2 Sampling Line Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Standard Sampling Line</li><li>Long Sampling Line</li></ul></p>
<p><p>EtCO2 sampling lines are essential for monitoring carbon dioxide levels during respiratory care. The standard sampling line is typically shorter, allowing for quick and reliable CO2 measurements in close proximity to the patient, ideal for routine assessments. In contrast, the long sampling line is designed for scenarios where the patient is positioned further away from the monitoring equipment, such as in critical care settings. Both types ensure accurate sampling while offering flexibility depending on clinical requirements and patient positioning.</p></p>
