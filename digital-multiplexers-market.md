<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Multiplexers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Synchronous TDM</li><li>Anynchronous TDM</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The digital multiplexers market is divided into two main types: Synchronous Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) and Asynchronous TDM. Synchronous TDM allocates time slots to each input signal at fixed intervals, ensuring consistent bandwidth usage but may lead to idle times if the source is inactive. In contrast, Asynchronous TDM assigns time slots based on demand, allowing more efficient bandwidth utilization by prioritizing active sources. Both types cater to varied applications, influencing demand in telecommunications, data centers, and broadcasting.</p></p>
