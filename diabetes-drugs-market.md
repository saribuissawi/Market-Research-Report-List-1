<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diabetes Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Insulin</li><li>DPP-4</li><li>GLP-1</li><li>SGLT-2</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The diabetes drugs market consists of several key types. Insulin is critical for managing Type 1 diabetes and advanced Type 2 diabetes, helping regulate blood sugar levels. DPP-4 inhibitors enhance incretin levels, promoting insulin release and lowering blood sugar. GLP-1 receptor agonists mimic natural gut hormones to improve glucose control and promote weight loss. SGLT-2 inhibitors prevent glucose reabsorption in kidneys, promoting its excretion and aiding in weight management and cardiovascular benefits. Each class offers distinct mechanisms for diabetes management.</p></p>
